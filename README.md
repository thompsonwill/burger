# Eat That Burger

Thank you for viewing my burger app's Github page. Eat that burger is a simple app showcasing node, express, and mysql technologies.

Simply clone the repo, enter your database information in the conneciton.js file, npm install and you're good to go.

To use the app, add burgers to the list and then eat them. It's that easy.
